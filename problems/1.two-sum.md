## Problem Source

[1. Two Sum | Easy](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/two-sum)

## Problem Description

```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Approach

- Letâ€™s start with the first element `2` and ask a simple question, what number must be added to `2` in order to get a value of 9. To find this, we simply take `9 - 2 = 7`, so the answer is `7`.
- All we need to do now is scan the list for the number `7`. If `7` exists, we know that it is a solution, otherwise, we move on.

## Key Points

- The key to the problem is that there is **always** only one pair of numbers that satisfy the condition of adding together to be the target value.
- We can assume that for all the numbers in the list (x1, x2, ... xn) that there exists a pair such that `xa + xb = target`
- To solve this with a single pass of the list we can change the equation above to `xa = target - xb` and since we know the target as long as we maintain a record of all previous values in the list we can compare the current value (xa) to it's **only** pair, if it exists, in record of all previous values (xb)


## Solution

- To keep a record of the previous values and their indices I have used a `dictionary`. Commonly known as a map in other languages. This allows me to record each previous number in the dictionary alongside the indice as a key value pair `{target-number: indice}`.

## Code

- Support Language: Python

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num in dic:
                return [dic[num], idx]
            else:
                dic[target - num] = idx
```
